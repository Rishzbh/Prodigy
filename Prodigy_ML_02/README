# Customer Segmentation using K-means Clustering

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a K-means clustering algorithm for customer segmentation based on purchase history. The project is part of the Machine Learning internship at Prodigy InfoTech.

## Description
The task involves:
- Analyzing a retail store's customer purchase history dataset.
- Applying K-means clustering to group customers based on their purchasing behavior.
- Visualizing clusters to identify distinct customer segments.
- Providing insights based on the segmentation results.

## Files
- `customer_segmentation.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the clustering implementation.
- `purchase_history.csv`: Dataset used for customer segmentation analysis.

## Timeline
- Start: 1st November, 23
- End: 30th November, 23
- Submission: 5th December, 23
