# Hand Gesture Recognition Model

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a model to recognize and classify various hand gestures from image or video data. The goal is to create a system that enables intuitive human-computer interaction and gesture-based control systems.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to:
- Train a deep learning model capable of accurately identifying and classifying different hand gestures.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this task comprises images or video frames depicting different hand gestures. The dataset consists of:
- Classes representing distinct hand gestures.
- Image/video samples for each gesture.

## Implementation
The model development involves the following steps:
1. Data preprocessing and exploration.
2. Selection and implementation of a suitable deep learning architecture.
3. Training the model on the dataset.
4. Evaluating the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
5. Fine-tuning the model for enhanced accuracy and efficiency.

## Requirements
- Python (version X.X)
- Deep learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- Libraries: (list libraries and versions)

## Usage
